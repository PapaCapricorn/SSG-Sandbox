                  <h1g>Power Calculator Math</h1g>

                  <p>
                  You may be wondering how the power calculator computes
                  probabilities.  In order to understand the math,
                  we need to discuss
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient" target="_blank">
                  binomial coefficients</a> and
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution" target="_blank">
                  hypergeometric distributions</a>.

                  <p>
                  A binomial coeffient (sometimes referred to as
                  "`n` choose `k`") is a way of computing the number of
                  ways to select a subset of items from a larger
                  collection.  In the context of a card game, we can
                  use it to compute the number of different `n` card
                  hands drawn from a `N` card deck.

                  <p>
                  `
                  ((N),(n)) = (N!)/(n!(N-n)!)
                  `

                  <p>
                  `N =` Cards in deck
                  <br>
                  `n =` Number of cards drawn

                  <p>
                  While `((N),(n))` will give us the number of different
                  hands possible to draw, it doesn't directly give us any
                  probabilities.  However, we can get the
                  probability of drawing exactly `k` power cards from a
                  deck containing `K` power cards (of `N` cards total)
                  by dividing the number of possible hands containing
                  `k` power cards by the number of total possible hands.
                  This is referred to as a hypergeometric
                  distribution.

                  <p>
                  `
                  P(k) =
                    (((K),(k))((N-K),(n-k))) /
                    (((N),(n)))
                  `

                  <p>
                  `K =` Power cards in deck
                  <br>
                  `k =` Power cards drawn
                  <br>
                  `N =` Total cards in deck
                  <br>
                  `n =` Total cards drawn

                  <p>
                  So, that's useful.  `P(k)` will give us the probability
                  of drawing a hand of exactly `k` power cards.  However,
                  we usually care about the probability of drawing
                  <em>at least</em> `k` power cards, rather than the
                  probability of drawing exactly `k` power cards.  We
                  can find the probability of drawing at least
                  `k` power by adding up the probability values for
                  every value of `k`, up to the maximum number of power
                  cards.

                  <p>
                  `P(k >= T) = sum_(i=T)^(K) P(i)`

                  <p>
                  `K = ` Power cards in deck
                  <br>
                  `k = ` Power cards drawn
                  <br>
                  `T = ` Target power cards
                  <br>
                  `n = ` Total cards drawn

                  <p>
                  Okay, so now we know how to compute the probability
                  of drawing enough power.  But what if we care about
                  multiple kinds of influence?  As it turns out, we can
                  generalize the hypergeometric distribution to compute
                  probabilities when we care about multiple different
                  card types drawn.  For example, fire influence drawn
                  and time influence drawn.

                  <p>
                  `
                  P(k_F,k_T) =
                    (((K_F),(k_F))
                    ((K_T),(k_T))
                    ((N-K_F-K_T),
                      (n-k_F-k_T)))
                    /
                    (((N),(n)))
                  `

                  <p>
                  `K_F =` Fire influence cards in deck
                  <br>
                  `K_T =` Time influence cards in deck
                  <br>
                  `k_F =` Fire influence cards drawn
                  <br>
                  `k_T =` Time influence cards drawn
                  <br>
                  `N =` Total cards in deck
                  <br>
                  `n =` Total cards drawn

                  <p>
                  Again, this will give us the probability
                  `P(k_F, k_T)` of an exact number of
                  fire and time, but we usually care about drawing
                  <em>at least</em> that much, so we'll need to
                  add together all the possible combinations of at
                  least those target numbers.

                  <p>
                  `
                  P(k_F>=T_F, k_T>=T_T) =
                      sum_(i=T_F)^(K_F)
                      sum_(j=T_T)^(K_T)
                      P(i, j)
                  `

                  <p>
                  Now we're getting somewhere!  However, the above math
                  is still a simplified version of what the power
                  calculator <em>actually</em> does.  All the above
                  math assumes that individual cards provide one kind
                  of influence, but not more than one kind of influence,
                  or both power and influence.
                  As we know, in reality, cards can provide multiple
                  kinds of things:
                  perhaps power <em>and</em> time influence,
                  or power <em>and</em>
                  time influence <em>and</em> fire influence.

                  <p>
                  In order to account for this, the Power Calculator
                  first groups cards according to the sorts of
                  resources they produce.
                  After generating these groupings, it will enumerate
                  all possible combinations of those grouping which
                  &mdash; when combined &mdash; will generate enough
                  power and influence to satisfy
                  the target power and influence cost.  For each of
                  those enumerated combinations, it will compute the
                  probability of drawing that specific number of
                  sources from each group.  Finally, it will sum
                  those probability to find an overall probability
                  of satisfying the target cost.

                  <p>
                  As an example, consider the case
                  where we have a deck with three groups of
                  power/influence sources:  time sigils (<tt>1T</tt>),
                  fire sigils (<tt>1F</tt>), and additional power sources
                  which provide both fire and time (<tt>1FT</tt>).

                  Now, say we want to find the probability of being able
                  to play a card costing <tt>2FT</tt>.  We can sum up the
                  possible combination of grouped cards which will provide
                  enough power and influence to satisfy the overall cost:

                  <p>
                  `
                  P_(2FT) = {:
                      (P(k_(1FT) >= 2, k_(1T) >= 0, k_(1F) >= 0)),
                      (+),
                      (P(k_(1FT) = 1, k_(1T) >= 1, k_(1F) >= 0)),
                      (+),
                      (P(k_(1FT) = 1, k_(1T) = 0, k_(1F) >= 1)),
                      (+),
                      (P(k_(1FT) = 0, k_(1T) >= 1, k_(1F) >= 1))
                  :}
                  `

                  <p>
                  Thus, the calculator will compute
                  the probability for each specific combination
                  of grouped cards which happens to satisfy the
                  target cost, and then sum those probabilities
                  into an the overall probability value.
              </pg>

              <h1g>The Mulligan Phase</h1g> Deciding whether or
              not to keep your opening hand is a strategic decision in <strong>Eternal</strong>.
              If you choose to re-draw, your starting hand is guaranteed to include
              either 2, 3 or 4 power cards (with an equal chance of each). <br>
              <br>
              This raises your chances of having more <strong>Influence</strong> to
              start with - so (generally speaking) your odds may be ever-so-slightly
              higher than what is actually depicted on the charts in the <strong>Eternal
                Power Calculator</strong>.

              <h1g>Pre-requisites</h1g>
              On the other
              hand, some power sources have a <strong>Power </strong>cost
              associated with them. <em><strong>Seek Power </strong></em>and the
              five <em><strong>Favors</strong></em> are the most obvious examples.
              <br>
              <br>
              The <strong>Eternal Power Calculator</strong> considers any card that
              increases your <strong> Power</strong> to be a <strong>Power</strong>
              source when determining probabilities. But it does not consider the
              sequence in which cards are played.<br>
              <br>
              In other words, including <em><strong>Vara's Favor</strong></em> in
              your deck will increase the overall chances of reaching your desired<strong>
                Shadow Influence</strong> costs. But because it can not be played
              until Turn 2,&nbsp; if you draw <em><strong>Vara's Favor </strong></em><strong></strong>instead
              of a <strong>Power </strong>card your true odds of achieving <img src="../icon-shadow.png"

                alt="Shadow" title="Shadow" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;"> on <strong>Turn
                1</strong> will be ever-so-slightly lower than what is represented
              on the charts.
